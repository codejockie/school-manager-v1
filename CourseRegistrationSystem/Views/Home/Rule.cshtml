    <h2>Registration Rule</h2>
    <p>
        Please note that in order to register your courses for each semester you have to ensure that your system's date is correct and set to the present day/month/year on which you are registering. This is so as to avoid loading previous semester courses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Registration begins two weeks after resumption for each semester, and ends two months after the begin date. After the ending date, a grace period is allowed for those that couldn't register. This period is termed late registration period and it attracts a fine of #2,000 to be paid to departmental account.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the registration page you can click on each elective course under the <span class="text-info rule">"Course Type"</span> column to find out more on the course, clicking again disables the popover. You could also simply hover on each course under the <span class="text-info rule">"Course Title"</span> column to see a tooltip.
