The various files in the Models folder represent their respective DB tables

Course.cs => courses table
Enrollment.cs => enrollment table
Role.cs => roles table
RoleUsers.cs => role_users table
Student.cs => students table
User.cs => users table

Each file has two classes in them, the first class is for the tables and the second class is used
to map the first class' properties to their respective table columns.
In the First class of each file, the properties defined in them represent their columns in their respective tables.

I've only explained the Course.cs file, but same logic applies to other files in the Models folder
